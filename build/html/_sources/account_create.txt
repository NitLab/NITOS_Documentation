Creating a User Account
========================

The first step you need to do before you can use NITOS is to create your NITlab account. This process is simple. Underneath the login boxes, click the **“Create an account”** link. Fill in the required information. Once you click the **“Register”** button, a confirmation mail will come to you and when you confirm it, your request will be sent to the administrator for approval. When the administrator approves the creation of your account, you will receive a confirmation email. 

*Example*:

#. Visit http://nitlab.inf.uth.gr/NITlab/
#. Click "Create an account"
#. | **Name**: Simos Iordanidis
   | **Username**: syiordan 
   | **Password**: 1234
   | **Confirm Password**: 1234
   | **Email Address**: syiordan@inf.uth.gr
   | **Confirm email Adress**: syiordan@inf.uth.gr
   
   Click Register
#. | Confirm the mail you've received from administrator.
    The administrator will approve the creation of your account.

You are ready! You are a member of NITOS. You can now continue to the next topic.
