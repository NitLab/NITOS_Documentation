Getting a Slice and Reserving Resources
=======================================
All access to NITOS resources occurs through the “slice” abstraction.

The NITlab Administrator is in charge of managing your slice. You will need to contact him directly and ask him/her to either create a new slice for you, or add your user account to an existing slice.Once your account has been associated to a slice, you will be able to view the **Reservation page** and the **"Your ssh-keys"** page, at the User Menu on the right of the NITlab's webpage.

You can then go to the **Reservation page** and reserve nodes and frequencies for a given interval.

Slice names typically coincide with your NITlab webpage's account username. For example if your username is **"syiordan"**, then your slice's name will probably be **"syiordan"**. In the following topics, we will assume that your slice is named **username**. You should replace this value with your slice’s actual name whenever you encounter it.
