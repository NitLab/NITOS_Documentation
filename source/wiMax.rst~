WiMax Example
=================

1.Basics
----------
Firstly,you will see how to connect and use WiMax.You'll also see how to develop and run a simple experiment where the WiMAX interface is setup and generate traffic between two nodes.

2.Prerequisties
-----------------------
*Accessing/Provisioning Resources*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| **Accessing a Resource at NITOS**
|
| Firstly, you have to reserve a node at NITOS: :ref:`label-name`

| In order to use the WiMAX testbed resources offered by the NITOS facility, you will have to reserve the WiMAX base station and the nodes
  with WIMAX connectivity, offered by the testbed (**Icarus nodes41-49**).

| Reserving the base station will render rights to the experimenter to access the WiMAXrf services of the testbed, used to configure and setup  the base station at the experimenter's will.

| *After your reservation has started,login to Server.*

.. warning:: You have to connect to **Nitos Server2**!

You can use your NITlab account to access the Nitos Server2.Just open a secure shell,write **ssh slice_name@nitlab2.inf.uth.gr** (i.e syiordan@nitlab2.inf.uth.gr) and log into the server. 

| **Provisioning a Resource at NITOS**
|
| You can use the method described on :ref:`label-name-2` for instruction on how to image resources at NITOS. Load on your resource a disk image that is compatible for WiMax experimentation such as **fgre_2014.ndz**.

3.Experimental Topology
-------------------------------
The topology that we are examining in this tutorial is a central Base Station unit, able to route requests from an internal WiMAX network to the internet.

 * The Base Station is using the 192.168.55.1 IP address
 * Multiple clients use the 192.168.55.0/24 subnet to communicate with the Base Station
 * Packets routed through the Base Station are sent over the internet through a NAT translation

.. image:: _static/wimax-topo.png 


However, the devices that we currently use do not allow us to interface directly the WiMAX device. If you send the following command

**root@node044:~# ifconfig tel0** 

you will all get an output similar to the following:

.. note:: | tel0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1e:42:02:18:72
          |          inet addr:192.168.0.8 Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          |          inet6 addr: fe80::21e:42ff:fe02:1872/64 Scope:Link
          |          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          |          RX packets:19939 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          |          TX packets:325172 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          |          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          |          RX bytes:6477672 (6.4 MB)  TX bytes:486501878 (486.5 MB)

Since the WiMAX devices need a rather complex configuration in order to allow access to the WiMAX interfaces of another node,you have to issue the following command:

.. note:: | root@node044:~# wmxfix

4.Connecting to the WiMAX Network 
----------------------------------
In order to connect to the Base Station, issue the following commands:

.. note:: | wget --http-user admin --http-password admin -qO - "http://192.168.0.1/cgi/cli?stopSs"
          | wget --http-user admin --http-password admin -qO - "http://192.168.0.1/cgi/cli?addChannel frequency=2590000 bandwidth=10"
          | wget --http-user admin --http-password admin -qO - "http://192.168.0.1/cgi/cli?startSs"

The first one, instructs the dongle to disconnect from any network that it is attached on. The second command, instructs the dongle to use the WiMAX channel at 2590MHz with a 10MHz channel bandwidth. Finally, with the third command the dongle connects to the NITOS WiMAX network. 
You can verify that the dongle has connected by sending the following command:

.. note:: ping 192.168.55.3 

If the host responds, you are connected to the Base Station. Host 192.168.55.3 is the server behind the Base Station, responsible for configuring it and routing the traffic coming from it.

5.Set up experimentation properties of the BS
----------------------------------------------
| Before user starts an experiment with WiMax he/she has to configure BS with the specific parameters he/she wants.There is a basic command
  available to get or set the required parameters to BS.This is the  **'wget'** command.

| As soon as the parameters set,the experimenter can submit a new Experiment Definition(ED) written in OMF Experiment Description Language
  submit it to OMF's EC.

| WiMax services are seperated in two categories.The first one to configure the BS and the other one to configure the mobile clients.A 
  description of these services is available to user,through the command :
  **' wget -qO- "http://wimaxrf:5054/wimaxrf/" '**

Services for BS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **bs/arq**
  
  .. note :: Set ARQ parameters

| **bs/harq**
  
  .. note :: Set HARQ parameters

| **bs/security**
  
  .. note :: Set SECURITY parameters

| **bs/wireless**
 
  .. note :: Set WIRELESS parameters

| **bs/zone**
  
  .. note :: Set ZONE parameters

| The above services show to the experimenter a sort description relative to functionality of the service which provide , permitted values and 
  the name of parameters which the user can configure and provision to bs.


| **bs/get**
 
  .. note :: Get Basestation Static Parameter

| **bs/set**
  
  .. note :: Set Basestation Static Parameter

| **bs/get** and **bs/set** are two functions which required the name of parameter and value in order to configure the Base station.

| For example if the user wants to change the transmission power of Base station to 40 db then he/she has to go to wireless service and there  
  will find a parameter “txpower” .Then he/she has to write the wget command : 
| **wget -qO- " http://wimaxrf:5054/wimaxrf/bs/set?txpower=40 "**
| If the user wants to know the current transmission power then the only change he/she has to do in wget is replace the bs/set with bs/get   
  and obviously no value required .
| **wget -qO- " http://wimaxrf:5054/wimaxrf/bs/get?txpower "** 

| **bs/default**

  .. note :: In order to setup the BS to the default settings.
             
| **bs/info**
    
  .. note :: Get information about the Base Station  
 
| **bs/inservice**
    
  .. note :: Set Base Station in service state
  
| **bs/maintenance**
    
  .. note :: Set Base Station to maintenance state
  
| **bs/restart**
    
  .. note :: Restart the base station.
 
| **bs/status**
  
  .. note :: Get status of WiMAX RF service

Services for mobile clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **mobileclient**
  
  .. note :: You can set/get MOBILE parameters using the mobileclient service only

| **mobileclient/monitor**

  .. note :: Get information about the mobile station

| **mobileclient/reregister**

  .. note :: Reregister Mobile station

| **mobileclient/showregister**
 
  .. note :: Get all register  mobiles stations
  
| Once you have logged in, you should setup the base station to the default settings, as its configuration might have been altered from its   
  normal behavior by any previous experimenter. In order to setup the BS to the default settings you issue the following command:
  **wget -qO- " http://wimaxrf:5054/wimaxrf/bs/default "** 

| Since not all of the changes take place immediately, you will need to restart the base station for some of the changes to take effect. You  
  can restart the BS with the following command:
  **wget -qO- " http://wimaxrf:5054/wimaxrf/bs/restart "**

| Since the BS is back to its default settings, you can start experimenting with the WiMAX testbed. 


6.Developing the experiment 
----------------------------

To run an experiment with OMF, you first need to describe it into an Experiment Description (ED). An ED is a file/script that is supplied as an input to the Experiment Controller (EC). It contains a detailed description of the resources involved in an experiment and the sets of actions to perform in order to realize that experiment. An ED is written using the OMF Experiment Description Language (OEDL).

The ED for our experiment:

.. note :: 
          | defProperty('runtime',20,"Time in second for the experiment is to run")
          | defProperty('client',"192.168.55.48","IP address of iperf server")
          | defProperty('interval', "1", "Interval of Iperf measurements")
          | defProperty('sender', 'omf.nitos.node043', "ID of sender node")
          | defProperty('receiver', 'omf.nitos.node048', "ID of sender node")
 
          | defGroup('Sender', property.sender) do | node |
          |  node.net.t0.channel = "2590000,10"
          |  node.addApplication("test:app:iperf-5.4") do | app |
          |    app.setProperty('client', property.client)
          |    app.setProperty('interval', property.interval)
          |    app.setProperty('time', property.runtime)
          |    app.setProperty('udp', true)
          |    app.measure('transfer', :samples =>1)
          |  end
          | end
 
          | defGroup('Receiver', property.receiver) do | node |
          |  node.net.t0.channel = "2590000,10" 
          |  node.addApplication("test:app:iperf-5.4") do | app |
          |    app.setProperty('server', true)
          |    app.setProperty('interval', property.interval)
          |    app.setProperty('udp', true)
          |    app.measure('transfer', :samples =>1)
          |  end
          | end
 
 
          | onEvent(:ALL_UP_AND_INSTALLED) do | event |
          |  wait 50
          |  info "This is an iperf  experiment using a teltonika modem"
          |  allGroups.startApplications
          |  wait property.runtime
          |  wait 2
          |  allGroups.stopApplications
          |  wait 2
          |  Experiment.done
          | end

7.Running Experiment
---------------------
You can run it from the testbed server with the following command:

**omf exec experiment.rb --slice your_username**

.. csv-table:: **Screen Output**
   :header: "When running the EC with the above command, you should see an output similar to this :"
   :widths: 160

   "INFO NodeHandler: OMF Experiment Controller 5.4 (git 3105a52)"

   "INFO exp: Request from Experiment Script: Wait for 50s...."
   "INFO exp: This is an iperf  experiment using a teltonika modem"
   "INFO exp: Request from Experiment Script: Wait for 20s...."
   "INFO exp: Request from Experiment Script: Wait for 2s...."
   "INFO exp: Request from Experiment Script: Wait for 2s...."
   "INFO EXPERIMENT_DONE: Event triggered. Starting the associated tasks."
   "INFO NodeHandler: "
   "INFO NodeHandler: Shutting down experiment, please wait..."
   "INFO NodeHandler: "
   "INFO run: Experiment ardadouk-2014-09-15t17.13.25+03.00 finished after 1:20"

8.Accessing Results
--------------------
You can access your results in /tmp file with sqlite3.

Type a command similar to this:

**ardadouk@nitlab2:~# sqlite3 /tmp/ardadouk-2014-09-15t17.13.25+03.00.sq3**
