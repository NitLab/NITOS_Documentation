Wireless Example
=================

1.Basics
---------


This simple tutorial presents all the basic steps to develop, run, and access the result of a wireless network experiment with OMF 6. 


Experiment Scenario

This experiment involves two resources of type PC with wireless capabilities: Node 1 and Node 2
Node 1 is running a simple UDP traffic generator application (OTG2)
Node 2 is running a simple traffic receiver application (OTR2)
Node 1 is the “Sender” and will generate and send traffic to the “Receiver” node 2, over a wireless (IEEE 802.11g) channel.
OTG and OTR are OML-enabled applications and are configured to report statistics about the sent and received traffic to an OML server.







2.Prerequisties
----------------

*a) Accessing/Provisioning Resources*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **Accessing a Resource at NITOS**
|
| Firstly, you have to reserve a node at NITOS: :ref:`label-name`

| **Provisioning a Resource at NITOS**
|
| You can use the method described on :ref:`label-name-2` for instruction on how to image resources at NITOS. Load on your resource a disk image that contains OMF6. For example load the image *baseline_grid_omf6_1_1.ndz*.

3. Developing the Experiment
-------------------------------------------

To run an experiment with OMF, you first need to describe it into an Experiment Description (ED). An ED is a file/script that is supplied as an input to the Experiment Controller (EC). It contains a detailed description of the resources involved in an experiment and the sets of actions to perform in order to realize that experiment. An ED is written using the OMF Experiment Description Language (OEDL).

The ED for our experiment: :download:`ED_script <tutorial01.rb>`.

You can see `here <http://omf.mytestbed.net/projects/omf6/wiki/OEDLOMF6>`_  more about (OMF6-OEDL) 

4. Running Experiment
-----------------------

*a) How do you run it?*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run your experiment you have to:

  * save its description in a file on your computer, thus either
     * cut-and-paste the above ED listing into a new file named 'tutorial01.rb'
     * download the ED directly: :download:`ED_script <tutorial01.rb>`

  * open a terminal and navigate to the folder/directory where you saved that file

  * start the EC software and tell it to execute the experiment described in your ED file, using the command line:

     omf_ec -u xmpp://usr:pwd@my_xmpp.com exec --oml_uri tcp:srv:port tutorial000.rb

     * replace xmpp://usr:pwd@srv with the credentials for your user on the xmpp pubsub server that is used to communicate with the resources
     * replace tcp:srv:port with the hostname/IP and port of the OML2 server which will collect the experiment's measurement

  * So for our example, xmpp server and OML server run at nitlab.inf.uth.gr. Then you would use the command:

     omf_ec -u xmpp://nitlab.inf.uth.gr exec --oml_uri tcp:nitlab.inf.uth.gr:3003 tutorial000.rb

If you would like to know more about the other options of the OMF EC software please run the commands:

    | omf_ec help
    | omf_ec help exec

*b) What will happen next?*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| When running the EC with the above command, you should see an output similar to this :
