Using your slice to run OMF experiments
========================================
There are two ways to use your slice in order to run OMF experiments during your reservation. The first way is to install the OMF *Experiment Controller* locally at your PC and configure it appropriately and the second way is to issue OMF commands when logged in the server giving your slice as an option. We strongly recommend the second option, since every necessary compoment is in place in our Server, so we describe just the second method below.
Running OMF Experiment Controller from the server

You can run OMF experiments while logged in the NITOS console server with your account. All you have to do is use the *--slice username* option when running the *omf exec* command (replacing username with your actual username).
